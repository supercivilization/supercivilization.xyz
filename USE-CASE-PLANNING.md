## 🚀 Example Use Cases to Consider

### 1. AI-Powered Community Q&A

**Priority:** 🔴 High

**Description:**
Help users get instant answers about civilization building, resource management, and community guidelines using an AI assistant.

**AI SDK Used:**
- [x] Vercel AI SDK (chat)
- [x] @vercel/flags (gradual rollout)
- [ ] streamdown

**User Flow:**
1. User asks question in community forum
2. AI assistant analyzes question context
3. Generates answer based on documentation + past discussions
4. Presents answer with sources
5. User can upvote/downvote AI response

**Technical Requirements:**
- Chat API endpoint with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Vector database for documentation search (Supabase pgvector)
- Rate limiting: 10 questions per user per day
- Estimated cost: $0.02 per interaction

**Success Metrics:**
- 70%+ helpful rating from users
- <3s response time
- <5% error/inappropriate response rate

**Rollout Strategy:**
- [x] Internal testing (admins only)
- [ ] Beta rollout (10% of active users via flag)
- [ ] Expand to 50% of users
- [ ] Full release

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: Hallucinated/incorrect answers → Mitigation: Always show sources, allow reporting
- Risk: High API costs → Mitigation: Rate limiting, caching common questions
- Risk: Inappropriate content → Mitigation: Content filtering, moderation queue

### 2. Smart Content Generation

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**
Help users draft civilization proposals, announcements, and documentation with AI assistance.

**AI SDK Used:**
- [x] Vercel AI SDK (completion)
- [x] streamdown (streaming markdown)
- [x] @vercel/flags (A/B test different models)

**User Flow:**
1. User selects content type (proposal/announcement/doc)
2. Fills in basic template or prompts
3. AI generates first draft in real-time (streaming)
4. User edits and refines
5. Publishes or saves draft

**Technical Requirements:**
- Completion API with templates
- Real-time markdown rendering
- Draft storage in Supabase
- Rate limiting: 5 generations per user per day
- Estimated cost: $0.05 per generation

**Success Metrics:**
- 60%+ of AI-generated content published (vs abandoned)
- <5s time to first token
- 80%+ user satisfaction

**Rollout Strategy:**
- [ ] Beta for moderators only
- [ ] Expand to premium users
- [ ] Free tier with limits

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: Low quality outputs → Mitigation: Template engineering, user feedback
- Risk: Plagiarism concerns → Mitigation: Originality checks, citations
- Risk: Abuse/spam → Mitigation: Rate limiting, quality filters

### 3. Intelligent Search & Discovery

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**
Semantic search across civilizations, resources, and discussions with AI-powered relevance ranking.

**AI SDK Used:**
- [x] Vercel AI SDK (embeddings)
- [ ] streamdown
- [x] @vercel/flags (test different ranking algorithms)

**User Flow:**
1. User enters natural language search query
2. AI converts query to embeddings
3. Vector search finds relevant content
4. AI re-ranks results by relevance
5. Results displayed with highlighted context

**Technical Requirements:**
- Embedding generation API
- Supabase pgvector for storage
- Real-time search indexing
- Rate limiting: 50 searches per user per day
- Estimated cost: $0.01 per search

**Success Metrics:**
- Top 3 results relevant in 85%+ of searches
- <1s search response time
- 2x increase in content discovery vs traditional search

**Rollout Strategy:**
- [ ] Parallel testing (show both old & new results)
- [ ] A/B test with 50% of users
- [ ] Full replacement of old search

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: Slow performance → Mitigation: Caching, precomputed embeddings
- Risk: Irrelevant results → Mitigation: User feedback loop, tuning
- Risk: High costs → Mitigation: Batch processing, result caching

### 4. Auto-Moderation Assistant

**Priority:** 🔴 High

**Description:**
AI-assisted content moderation to flag inappropriate content, spam, and policy violations.

**AI SDK Used:**
- [x] Vercel AI SDK (classification)
- [x] @vercel/flags (adjust sensitivity)
- [ ] streamdown

**User Flow:**
1. User posts content
2. AI analyzes content for violations
3. If flagged, content goes to moderation queue
4. Moderator reviews with AI explanation
5. Moderator approves/rejects with feedback

**Technical Requirements:**
- Classification API endpoint
- Moderation queue in Supabase
- Real-time processing (<500ms)
- Rate limiting: All content analyzed
- Estimated cost: $0.005 per analysis

**Success Metrics:**
- 95%+ accuracy (precision + recall)
- <10% false positive rate
- 50%+ reduction in moderator workload

**Rollout Strategy:**
- [x] Shadow mode (log only, don't act)
- [ ] Assist mode (flag for review)
- [ ] Auto-action mode (with human oversight)

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: False positives silencing users → Mitigation: Human review required
- Risk: Bias in moderation → Mitigation: Diverse training data, monitoring
- Risk: Gaming the system → Mitigation: Regular model updates
