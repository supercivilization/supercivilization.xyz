Supercivilization Regenerative Commons License v1.0
Copyright Â© 2025 Supercivilization

================================================================================

PREAMBLE

This license embodies regenerative principles: knowledge as commons, cooperation
over competition, and time-bounded sovereignty. Supercivilization is building a
parallel society that aspires to network state status through transparent,
values-aligned governance.

We believe parallel societies should cooperate on infrastructure, not compete.
This license builds a commons for network state technology while protecting our
community during critical growth phases.
